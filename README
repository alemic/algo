Just some basic algorithms and data structures in Go language. They were coded
when I was learning the Go, and I put them here in case any novice need to
refer to them.

DISCLAIMER: 
These implementations are not generalized and well tested. Rather,
they should be seen simply as serving the purpose of offering reference to
basic structure of several popular algorithm. I myself use some of them in my
project and every single time I need to make significant changes to adapt to
specific project.
